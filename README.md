This project uses an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and Arduino to create a radar system that scans 180 degrees to detect objects. When an object is detected within a specified range, it triggers an audible alert and displays the angle and distance on an LCD.
It also shows real time alerts on the temperature and humidity of its surroundings.
